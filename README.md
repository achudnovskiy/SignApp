# Sign

## Discover your city — one good place at a time.

Simply go about your day, and the app will notify you with a sign as you walk by one of the places on our curated list. No ratings, no overwhelming databases of businesses — just carefully selected spots we think you’d be glad to know.

You see hundreds of cafes, restaurants and galleries on your daily route. How many of them do you actually know? 5% at most? Do you ever feel you are missing out? With Sign, we’ll let you know.

- Receive new signs as you walk by places worth checking out
- Gather a collection unique to you
- Share signs with your friends

A groundbreaking idea? No. Just something to make your day a little better.

Currently in Vancouver, BC. But slowly growing.
